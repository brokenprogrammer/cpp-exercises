    Sum square difference
    Problem 6
    
    The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
    12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

    The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
    (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

    Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
    ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

    Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first 
    one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
