-- Problem 9
-- Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.
-- If a list contains repeated elements they should be placed in separate sublists.
--
-- Example:
-- pack ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'a', 'a', 'd', 'e', 'e', 'e', 'e']
-- ["aaaa","b","cc","aa","d","eeee"]

pack :: Eq a => [a] -> [[a]]
pack [] = []
pack [x] = [[x]]
pack (x:xs) = if x `elem` (head (pack xs))
              then (x:(head (pack xs))):(tail (pack xs))
              else [x]:(pack xs)
