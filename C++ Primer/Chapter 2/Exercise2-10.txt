What are the initial values, if any, of each of the following variables?

std::string global_str;
int global_int;
int main()
{
    int local_int;
    std::string local_str;
}

global_str : Is a global string so the value will be empty string.
global_int : Is a global variable so the value will be zero.
local_int  : Is a local variable so the value will be undefined.
local_str  : Is a local string but it has a value that is defined by the class. So it is empty string.
