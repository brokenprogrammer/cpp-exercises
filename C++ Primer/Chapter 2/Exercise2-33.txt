Using the variable definitions from this section, determine what happens
in each of these assignments:
	a = 42;	b = 42;	c = 42;
	d = 42; e = 42;	g = 42;

a = 42; // Sets the value 42 to the integer a.
b = 42; // Sets the value 42 to the integer b.
c = 42; // Sets the value 42 to the integer c.
d = 42; // Error, d is an int *. Corrent would be *d = 42;
e = 42; // Error, e is an const int*. Correct would be e = &c;
g = 42; // Error, g is an const int& bound to ci.
