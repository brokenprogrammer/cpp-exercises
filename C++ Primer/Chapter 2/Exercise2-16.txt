Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid? If they are valid, explain what they do.

int i = 0, &r1 = i;
double d = 0, &r2 = d;

(a) r2 = 3.14159; //Valid let d = 3.14159
(b) r2 = r1;	  //Valid Converting i to double d
(c) i = r2;	  //Valid value will be truncated
(d) r1 = d;	  //Valid value will be truncated
