Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why.

int i = 0;

   (a) double* dp = &i;
   (b) int *ip = i;
   (c) int *p = &i;

a) Illegal because a pointer has to point to the same type. A double pointer cannot point to an integer.
b) Illegal because a pointer stores a memory address and not the object itself. 
c) Legal, The pointer p now points to the integer i.
