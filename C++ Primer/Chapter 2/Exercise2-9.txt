(a): Error. Visual Studio says: type 'int' unexpected. Cannot initialize variable within a iostream call.
	//Fixed:
	int input_value = 0;
	std::cin >> input_value;
(b): Error: conversion from 'double' to 'int' requires a narrowing conversion. 
	//Fixed:
	double i = { 3.14 };
(c): If wage has been declared before this is ok otherwise an error of unexpected identifier will happend.
	//Fixed:
	double wage;
	double salary = wage = 9999.99;
(d): Legal but value will be truncated.
