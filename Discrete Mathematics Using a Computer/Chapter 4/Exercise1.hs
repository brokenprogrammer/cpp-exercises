-- Let a be an arbitrary real number. 
-- Prove, for all natural numbers m and n, that a^(m√ón) = (a^m)^n.
--
-- Suppose that a is in the set of real numbers. 
-- For all m, n where m and n is within the set of natural numbers a^mn = (a^m)^n
--
-- Proof by induction on n:
-- 
-- Base case, n = 0:
--  Left side           Right side
--  a^(m0) = a^0 = 1    (a^m)^0 = 1
--
-- Inductive case, n = k + 1:
-- We assume that a^(mk) = (a^m)^k
--
-- If a = 0, true because for all x in the natural numbers 0^x = 0.
-- Assume a is not equal to 0. Multiply both sides with a^m
--
-- Left side                                Right side
-- a^(mk) * a^k = a^(mk+m) = a^(m(k+1))     (a^m)^k * a^m = (a^m)^k+1
