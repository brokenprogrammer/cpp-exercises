-- Prove that the sum of the Ô¨Årst n odd positive numbers is n^2.
--
-- Proof by induction on n:
--
-- Base case, n = 0:
--  Left side   Right side
--  0           0
--
-- Inductive case, n = k + 1:
--  We assume that sum of the first k odd numbers is k^2.
--  The k + 1 th odd number is 2k + 1 so adding it to both sides gives
--  Left side                               Right side
--  sum of the first k + 1 odd numbers.     k^2 + 2k + 1 = (k + 1)^2
